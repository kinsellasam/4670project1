THIS IS THE README FILE FOR PROJECT 1 FOR CS4760
PROGRAMMER: SAM KINSELLA
DATE: 9/14/20

FILES IN THIS PROJECT: Main.java, mydu.java, root


A FEW BEGINNING NOTES: THERE IS A DIRECTORY (root) THAT HAS BEEN SUPPLIED AND IS
HARDCODED FOR THE DEFAULT PROGRAM TO RUN. THERE IS A MAKE FILE THAT WILL CLEAN
AND COMPILE THE PROJECT AS IT IS INTENDED. TYPE 'make' IN THE TERMINAL.

Main.java: This file is the first iteration of the project. If compiled and run,
which must be done with 'java Main', this project will run a depth-first search
and output the size of files and a sum of positive returns on files.

mydu.java: This is the main file for the project. There is user input, allowing
the user to change the directory that is being searched. The directory must be
entered the same way it shows up when the user uses the command 'pwd' from inside
of it.
